# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm Neeraja Tanuku, a recent B.Sc graduate with a background in mathematics, chemistry, and computer science. I have a passion for software development, cloud technologies, and data management, and I'm continuously working to improve my skills.

During my academic journey, I built a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.

I completed an internship at Glossary Soft Tech Limited Pvt, where I worked on web design projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly websites.

Currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge of AWS, MySQL, data analysis, and other programming languages through self-learning and hands-on projects.
